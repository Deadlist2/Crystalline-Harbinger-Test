	<ItemDescription>
	[i]&quot;Beneath the ruined mill with mindless huskes under control by the comet strucked, more shard alienage malignity emerges underneath the mill, roaming around to seek more unfortunate travelers to bring more demise...&quot;[/i]
	[h1]Description[/h1]
	[h1]----------------------------[/h1]
	This adds a new miniboss to Darkest Dungeon. This Harbinger, a newly constucted massive defensive shards with shells that are hard to break now infused with crystals that serves the comet beneath the shardy mill in the crystal alienage Farmstead. The crystal like claws that can tainted or tear up an unexpected traveler, and it&apos;s terrible gaze so unresilient that warps the mind unto the space and time of place unknown. The starspawn gazes upon the galaxy, of the Darkest Dungeon...
	
	[b]Note:[/b] The Crystalline Harbinger is a midgame to endgame encounter. After killing the Miller in the Second Farmstead quest, he will roam around the estate and has a 25% chance to spawn in all level dungeons like Thing from the Stars. He also appears in the Endless mode but becomes fearsome in it&apos;s homeland.
